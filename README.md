# Phase-1-WK1-Code-Challenge

**About the Code Challenge**

This is an assignment testing us on the content we learned in phase 1 week one.
The code challenge has been done in the below files:
    (i)Net-Salary-Calculator.js
    (ii)Speed-Detector.js
    (iii)Stedent-grade-generator.js


**Code challenge questions**

Challenge 1.
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 


        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.


Challenge 2: 
Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Challenge 3.
Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

_NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below._

Workflow:

1. I created a repository on your GitHub account. 
2. Every single file is holding one solution.
3. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.
4. Push the solution to the above repository once done.
5. Install the dependencies using npm install.
6. Run the node.js tests.
7. Read the errors; vocalize what they're asking you to do.
